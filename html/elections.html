                        <p>How would you predict an election? Elections are events with far-reaching consequences, but how would you predict one.</p>
                        <h1>Votes or Seats</h1>
                        <p>One potential method is to predict the number of votes earned by each party. Whichever party wins the most votes is the forecast winner. But just because a party, or candidate, earns more votes than another doesn't necessarily mean that that they'll be in government at the conclusion of the election. Examples of this are easy to come by, especially from the USA. In the UK too, vote share doesn't necessarily correlate with the number of seats won by each party. As the graph below should testify.</p>
                        <img class="img-fluid" src="/images/outcome_plot.png" width="700" height="300">
                        <p>It is interesting to note from this graph, that while three majority governments were formed between 2005-19. No party has received over a majority of the votes cast in any election during this period. Therefore showcasing the importance of focussing on seats as the predictor.</p>
                        <h1>Polling and Models</h1>
                        <p>Now that we know what we are predicting, let's start building a model. However, we already have a basic model with the polling data leading up to the election. For example, here is the polling data leading up to the 2005 election.</p>
                        <img class="img-fluid" src="/images/poll_plot2005.png" width="70" height="300">
                        <p>Looking at the polling, the race seemed pretty steady with Labour in the lead all the way until election day. The polls even correctly predicted the vote shares for both the Liberal Democrats and combined other parties, as both final results were within their LOESS model's standard errors. However, the models for the Labour and Conservative Parties missed the mark, perhaps owing to late swings from the former to the latter at the polling booth.</p>
                        <p>Not all races are as stable as the election of 2005 however. Indeed more recent elections have exposed some of the issues with forecasting elections using polls. Take the polling for the 2010 election dispayed below.</p>
                        <img class="img-fluid" src="/images/poll_plot2010.png" width="700" height="300">
                        <p>As we can see, not only did the polls failed to predict the voteshares for all but the combined other parties. What's more, the polls also got the order of the parties wrong, as they predicted that the Liberal Democrats would come second, not Labour as was the case.</p>
                        <p>But how well does a model based on polling forecast an election?</p>
