                        <p>Friends was a cultural phenomenon, pulling in millions of viewers during its 10 year run from 1994-2004. Even today you'll still find re-runs on Comedy Central and branded clothing on sale. A significant part of this success is because of the terrific writing staff. However, now the show has ended, would it be possible for an AI to fill the Friends-sized hole in the hearts of fans.</p>
                        <p>As always, all the R and Python code I've written for this project is contained within</p>
                        <h1>'The One with all the Data'</h1>
                        <p>The data we'll be using for this project is taken from a <a href="https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2020/2020-09-08">2020 edition</a> of the popular weekly data visualisation challenge 'Tidy Tuesday'. This edition not only contains data about the success of the show (no. of viewers per episode, IMDB rating, etc), but also a dataset of every line spoken by a character in the show. We'll use the former dataset to identify what data we'll use to train our model as it is simply not posible to train a model on the entire Friends script (I tried).</p>
                        <p>For this, we'll look at the average IMDB rating by season, to see if we can identify any outliers we can use as our data.</p> 
                        <img class="img-fluid" src="/images/friends_season_plot.png" width="700" height="300">
                        <p>Oh wow, a pretty strong consistentcy in the average quality between seasons. Perhaps this isn't the best approch for idetifying our data. Instead, maybe a better idea would be to look at the quality of individual episodes and select from the top 10 or so. Extracting the top episodes yields the following episodes that we'll use to train the model.</p>
                        <img class="img-fluid" src="/images/friends_table.png" width="700" height="300">
                        <p>This looks promising. We can then extract the script data for these episodes and use that to train our model.</p>
                        <h1>'The One with the LSTM'</h1>
                        <p>For the model, we'll be using a type of neual network called an Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) model. This type of model is different to other types of neural networks in that it contains information about time when receiving input information. This makes it particularly good for dealing with language data as the placement of words is vital when constructing a sentence.</p>
                        <img class="img-fluid" src="/images/friends_model.png" width="700" height="300">
                        <p>This model took quite a while to train (> 1 day) and I've detailed the underlying achitecture above.</p>
                        <h1>'The One with the AI Generated Script'</h1>
                        <p>With the model, we can then generate a scene using the model with a scene length and prompt. The average scene is around 1,681 words in length so we'll choose that length for our scene. While for the prompt we'll simply start with 'Scene Directions', as this is not only how pretty much all scenes start but because it'll also allow us to see what scene the model defines for the scene.</p>
                        <p>Now that now have these inputs, we can now generate the script. Running the model returns the following scene. I've formatted the generated text slightly so that it'll be easier to read, given that we had to remove the punctuation and capitalisation when cleaning the data.</p>
